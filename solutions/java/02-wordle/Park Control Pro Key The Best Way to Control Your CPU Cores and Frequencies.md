## What is CPU core parking and frequency scaling?
 
CPU core parking is a feature that allows the operating system to dynamically disable some CPU cores when they are not needed, in order to save power and reduce heat. This can be useful for laptops and other devices that run on battery power, but it can also reduce the responsiveness and performance of your CPU when you need it most.
 
Frequency scaling is another feature that allows the operating system to adjust the clock speed of the CPU cores depending on the workload. This can also help save power and reduce heat, but it can also introduce latency and instability when the CPU frequency changes rapidly.
 
## How does ParkControl Pro help you optimize these settings?
 
ParkControl Pro is a small GUI that allows you to enable or disable CPU core parking and frequency scaling in real time, without any reboot. You can also choose from different power plans that have different settings for these features, such as High Performance, Balanced, or Power Saver. You can also create your own custom power plan with your preferred settings.
 
ParkControl Pro also has some additional features that can help you optimize your CPU performance, such as:
 
- Bitsum Highest Performance Mode: This mode disables core parking and frequency scaling completely, and sets the CPU to its maximum performance state. This can be useful for gaming, video editing, or other demanding tasks that require full CPU power.
- Bitsum Dynamic Mode: This mode automatically switches between different power plans based on the CPU load. This can help you balance performance and power consumption without manual intervention.
- Changing Parking Settings: You can change the percentage of CPU cores that are allowed to be parked by the operating system. You can also change the threshold of CPU load that triggers core parking or unparking. This can help you fine-tune the core parking behavior to your liking.
